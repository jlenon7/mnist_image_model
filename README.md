## Running

To run the model first create a new Python environment and activate it. I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for setting the python version that pipenv should use to set up the environment. The command bellow will automatically setup the environment with conda and pipenv:

```shell
make env
```

Now install all the project dependencies:

```shell
make install-all
```

And run the model:

```shell
make model
```

> [!WARNING]
> Dont run `make model` without deleting `storage/mnist-image-model.keras`, this will
> cause train/test data over fitting.

After running you model, it will be saved inside `storage/mnist-image-model.keras`.
To just run your recent created model and predict a random value from our data set,
use the following script:

```shell
make predict 
```

> [!WARNING]
> In case you have deleted the `storage/mnist-image-model.keras`, remember that to get `make predict` working you need to run `make model` first to create it.

To run TensorBoard with the latest created version of the model within this
repository run:

```shell
make board
```
